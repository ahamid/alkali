The alkali metals are a set of elements known for being extremely reactive, conductive, and lightweight. The alkali library is a lightweight set of modules for accessing simple native JavaScript objects with modeling and reactivity capabilities. Alkali uses categorical models with contextualized calculations and caching, with an invalidation-based notification system. This makes it possible to build highly efficient and fast applications, with standard JavaScript objects using modern functionally reactive techniques.
